This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Let me chronologically analyze this comprehensive conversation about building an MCP TypeScript client and testing strategy:

  1. **Initial Context**: User provided VS Code search snippets showing issues with MCP search tools - semantic searches returning navigation guides 
  instead of actual code (like FloPy SMS package implementation)

  2. **Problem Analysis**: I analyzed the search patterns and identified that simple text search ("sms") found actual code, while complex semantic 
  queries returned navigation guides

  3. **Documentation Creation**: Created debug-search-analysis.md documenting effective vs ineffective search patterns

  4. **MCP SDK Research**: User requested research on official MCP SDK documentation for building a TypeScript client. I used Brave search and 
  WebFetch to gather comprehensive information from:
     - Official MCP documentation site (modelcontextprotocol.io)
     - Python SDK (github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
     - TypeScript SDK (github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

  5. **Roadmap Evolution**: Initially created an overly broad roadmap focusing on "system optimization engine" and performance benchmarking. User 
  corrected this multiple times:
     - Removed performance benchmarking as out of scope
     - Identified navigation guide contamination as a key issue
     - Clarified that the root cause might not just be navigation guides
     - Emphasized the need for systematic diagnosis

  6. **Scope Clarification**: User pointed out we have a complete ecosystem (Python→DB→MCP→Client) and that the client completes a feedback loop for 
  continuous improvement

  7. **Architecture Separation**: User requested separation into 3 focused documents instead of one overly complex roadmap

  8. **Final Documentation**: Created three separate documents:
     - TypeScript client roadmap (focused only on client implementation)
     - Testing strategy for current stack (systematic testing methodology)
     - Full-stack AI ecosystem architecture (industry best practices)

  9. **Git Operations**: Successfully committed and pushed all documentation

  Key technical decisions include using stdio transport, systematic search testing, content type analysis, and focusing on improving navigation guides
   through data-driven testing.

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user's primary goal was to create a TypeScript MCP client with stdio transport to systematically test search tools (semantic and text 
  searches) and improve navigation guides. The user explicitly wanted to "create an mcp client to test our tools locally" and later clarified the need
   to separate this into three focused documents: 1) TypeScript client roadmap, 2) testing strategy for current stack, and 3) full-stack AI ecosystem 
  architecture. The user emphasized removing performance benchmarking as "totally out of scope" and focusing on improving navigation guides and 
  resolving search result contamination issues.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Model Context Protocol (MCP) with stdio transport
     - TypeScript client implementation for systematic testing
     - Semantic vs text search effectiveness analysis
     - Navigation guide contamination detection and resolution
     - Content type analysis (code vs documentation vs guides)
     - FloPy SMS package search patterns as case study
     - PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings storage
     - Node.js MCP servers for search orchestration
     - Search result quality analysis and improvement
     - Systematic diagnosis and variable isolation testing
     - Closed-loop feedback system for continuous improvement

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/docs/debug-search-analysis.md`
       - Documents effective vs ineffective search patterns from VS Code snippets
       - Shows that simple text search "sms" found actual FloPy code while complex semantic queries returned navigation guides
       - Provides debugging framework for future MCP searches
     
     - `/docs/mcp-typescript-client-roadmap.md`
       - Comprehensive roadmap for TypeScript MCP client with stdio transport
       - Focuses purely on client implementation, search testing, and CLI interface
       - Removed ecosystem concerns to maintain clean scope
       - Includes 10-phase implementation plan from foundation to optimization
     
     - `/docs/testing-strategy-current-stack.md`
       - Systematic testing approach for existing Python→DB→MCP pipeline
       - Defines content type detection, search comparison methodologies
       - Includes test matrices for query complexity and repository-specific testing
     
     - `/docs/full-stack-ai-ecosystem-architecture.md`
       - Industry best practices for AI repository analysis systems based on Perplexity research
       - Covers modular architecture, vector database optimization, monitoring patterns
       - Provides technology stack recommendations and KPIs
     
     - `/mfai-mcp-cursor-wrapper/README.md` (examined)
       - Shows existing MCP wrapper for IDE integration with stdio-to-HTTP bridging
       - Demonstrates current infrastructure supporting multiple IDEs (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop)

  4. Problem Solving:
     Identified that navigation guides are contaminating search results, causing semantic searches to return guides instead of actual code. However, 
  determined that the root cause analysis requires systematic testing since the issue might not be solely navigation guide contamination but could 
  involve semantic search algorithms, embeddings quality, or query complexity thresholds. Created comprehensive testing framework to isolate variables
   and identify actual bottlenecks through empirical data rather than assumptions.

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - Implement TypeScript MCP client according to the roadmap
     - Execute systematic testing strategy to identify root causes of search issues
     - Generate data-driven improvements to navigation guides
     - Validate that proposed fixes actually solve identified problems

  6. Current Work:
     The most recent work completed was creating three focused documentation files and successfully committing them to git. The user requested "commit
   and push" after reviewing the three separated documents. I executed the git operations successfully, adding all four new documentation files with a
   structured commit message and pushing to the remote repository. The commit was successful with the hash 19be2c7.

  7. Optional Next Step:
     Based on the conversation, the next logical step would be to begin implementing the TypeScript MCP client according to the roadmap in 
  `/docs/mcp-typescript-client-roadmap.md`, starting with Phase 1: Project Foundation. However, since the documentation phase is now complete and no 
  explicit next implementation task was requested by the user, I should wait for the user to specify whether they want to proceed with client 
  implementation or have other priorities..
