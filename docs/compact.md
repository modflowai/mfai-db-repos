This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and architectural decisions:

  1. **Initial Context**: The conversation began with continuing from a previous session about MCP implementation issues, specifically content 
  overflow causing token limit errors (34,311 tokens exceeding 25,000 limit) when searching for "pest-ies" in pestpp repository.

  2. **User's Primary Request**: The user wanted to implement the roadmap from 
  `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/docs/mfai_intelligent_response_roadmap.md` and continue from the conversation context in 
  `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/docs/compact.md`. They provided API keys via 
  `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server_reposel/.env`.

  3. **Key Architectural Shift**: Early in the conversation, the user clarified a fundamental misunderstanding - they wanted document 
  retrieval/summarization, not query answering. This led to a major architectural change from "answer the query" to "provide optimized document 
  content."

  4. **Intelligence Definition**: The user corrected my understanding of what makes this "intelligent" - it's the query-focused compression for 
  large documents, not processing small documents. Small docs (< 8k tokens) should be returned as-is.

  5. **API Key Issues**: We discovered semantic search was failing due to missing OpenAI API key, which I initially handled with graceful fallback,
   then the user provided the actual API key.

  6. **Context Enhancement**: The user suggested adding a `context` parameter alongside `query` to provide richer guidance for compression, moving 
  beyond just FTS/semantic search terms.

  7. **Compression Problems**: We encountered a critical issue where Gemini wasn't properly compressing documents (returned 22,359 tokens instead 
  of ~8k), leading to aggressive prompt rewriting.

  8. **MCP Best Practices**: The user pointed out we were missing the repository list tool and requested following MCP best practices for tool 
  definitions and file structure.

  9. **Final Implementation**: Successfully implemented a dual-tool MCP server with proper architecture, then committed and pushed to git.

  Key technical decisions include: stdio transport, Gemini 2.0 Flash for compression, OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, PostgreSQL with Neon, 
  TypeScript with Zod validation, and a tool registry pattern.

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user's primary request was to implement the intelligent response roadmap from 
  `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/docs/mfai_intelligent_response_roadmap.md` and continue from the previous conversation context in 
  `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/docs/compact.md`. The core goal was to create a new MCP server (`mfai_mcp_server_response`) that processes 
  large repository documents and provides them in optimal format for LLM consumption. The user explicitly wanted:
     - Documents under 8k tokens returned as full content (no processing)
     - Large documents (35k+ tokens) intelligently compressed to exactly 8k tokens using query-focused compression
     - Support for both text and semantic search
     - A context parameter for enhanced compression guidance
     - Following MCP best practices with dual-tool architecture
     - Proper repository list functionality alongside document retrieval

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Model Context Protocol (MCP) with stdio transport
     - Google GenAI JS SDK (`@google/generative-ai`) with `gemini-2.0-flash-001` model
     - OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`) for semantic search
     - PostgreSQL with Neon serverless (`@neondatabase/serverless`)
     - TypeScript with Zod schema validation
     - Query-focused document compression (35k+ → 8k tokens)
     - Token counting and management (1 token ≈ 4 characters estimation)
     - Tool registry pattern for MCP servers
     - Graceful fallback mechanisms (semantic → text search)
     - Environment variable security for API keys

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/docs/compact.md`
       - Contains previous conversation context and architectural decisions
       - References the two-tool approach and token overflow problems
     
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/docs/mfai_intelligent_response_roadmap.md`
       - Updated throughout the conversation to reflect architectural changes
       - Changed from "answer queries" to "retrieve optimized document content"
       - Updated scenarios and examples to reflect query-focused compression
     
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server_response/src/lib/types/response-types.ts`
       - Defines interfaces for both tools:
       ```typescript
       export interface DocumentRetrievalInput {
         query: string;
         repository: string;
         search_type: 'text' | 'semantic';
         context?: string; // Optional context to guide compression
       }
       ```
     
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server_response/src/lib/ai/prompts.ts`
       - Contains aggressive compression prompts with query focus:
       ```typescript
       return `# EXTREME COMPRESSION REQUIRED
       You must compress this ${originalTokenCount}-token document to EXACTLY 7000 tokens (28,000 characters).
       **CRITICAL RULES:**
       1. **MAXIMUM 7000 tokens output** - This is MANDATORY
       2. **Focus 80% on relevant content** - Everything else is secondary
       ```
     
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server_response/src/lib/tools/index.ts`
       - Implements tool registry pattern following MCP best practices
       - Manages both `list_repositories_with_navigation` and `mfai_document_retrieval` tools
       - Provides centralized tool management and execution
     
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server_response/src/lib/services/gemini-response-service.ts`
       - Key compression service with strict token limits:
       ```typescript
       generationConfig: {
         temperature: 0.0,        // Zero temperature for maximum consistency
         maxOutputTokens: 7000,   // Hard limit at 7k tokens
       }
       ```

  4. Problem Solving:
     - **Token Overflow Issue**: Solved by implementing query-focused compression using Gemini 2.0 Flash
     - **Architectural Confusion**: Clarified that intelligence is in compression strategy, not query answering
     - **Compression Failure**: Fixed Gemini not following compression instructions by rewriting prompts to be more aggressive and direct
     - **Missing OpenAI API Key**: Resolved by adding proper API key to .env file and implementing graceful fallback
     - **MCP Best Practices**: Implemented proper tool registry pattern and modular architecture
     - **Missing Repository Tool**: Added `list_repositories_with_navigation` tool for complete functionality

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - None explicitly requested by the user. All major implementation tasks have been completed and successfully tested.

  6. Current Work:
     The most recent work involved successfully committing and pushing all changes to the git repository. The final implementation included:
     - Complete dual-tool MCP server with tool registry pattern
     - Working compression that keeps documents under 8k tokens (test showed 6,272 tokens)
     - Both repository listing and document retrieval functionality
     - Proper error handling and type safety
     - Context-guided compression support
     - OpenAI semantic search with text search fallback
     
     The user's final requests were: "git commit and push and push" which I completed with a comprehensive commit message covering all implemented 
  features.

  7. Optional Next Step:
     No explicit next steps were requested. The implementation is complete and successfully committed to git. The conversation concluded with 
  successful testing of both tools and git operations. Any future work would need explicit direction from the user since all stated requirements 
  have been fulfilled..
