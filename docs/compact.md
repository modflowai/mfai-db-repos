> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and architectural decisions:

  1. **Initial Problem Identification**: User identified a critical issue with the current MCP implementation - content overflow causing token limit errors (34,311 tokens 
  exceeding 25,000 limit) when searching for "pest-ies" in pestpp repository.

  2. **Architecture Discussion**: We discussed transforming from a "raw search tool" to an "intelligent assistant" pattern, exploring various approaches including Context7's
   two-tool pattern and Perplexity's single-tool approach.

  3. **Repository Selection Strategy**: User emphasized that repository selection is crucial since users work in specific stacks (MODFLOW, PEST, etc.) and conversation 
  context matters.

  4. **Two-Tool Approach Decision**: We settled on a two-tool approach:
     - `mfai_repository_selector`: Analyzes queries against navigation guides to suggest repositories
     - `mfai_intelligent_search`: Searches the confirmed repository

  5. **Technical Validation**: Used Perplexity Sonar Pro to validate the architecture, which confirmed it's sound and follows best practices.

  6. **Implementation Planning**: Created detailed roadmap for `mfai_mcp_server_reposel` using existing working MCP server as reference.

  7. **File Reference Corrections**: User corrected me to use the proper database connection pattern from the working stdio server, and updated documentation references.

  Key technical decisions made:
  - Use stdio transport for testing phase (not SSE)
  - Leverage existing database connection pattern with `MODFLOW_AI_MCP_00_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - Use Google GenAI JS SDK (`gemini-2.0-flash-001`) for intelligent repository selection
  - Follow proven MCP server architecture from working reference
  - Single repository focus to avoid confusion and token waste

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user's primary request is to solve a critical MCP implementation issue where file content is too large, causing token overflow errors (34,311 tokens exceeding 
  25,000 limit). They want to create a new intelligent MCP server that uses Google GenAI to select repositories before searching, following a two-tool approach: repository 
  selection followed by intelligent search. The goal is to transform from a "raw search tool" to an "intelligent assistant" pattern similar to Perplexity.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Model Context Protocol (MCP) with stdio transport
     - Google GenAI JS SDK (`@google/genai`) with `gemini-2.0-flash-001` model
     - PostgreSQL with Neon serverless (`@neondatabase/serverless`)
     - Repository navigation guides stored in database metadata
     - Two-tool architecture pattern (repository selector + intelligent search)
     - Token management and content overflow prevention
     - User-in-the-loop confirmation workflow
     - TypeScript with Zod schema validation

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server/src/index.ts`
       - Reference implementation for stdio MCP server
       - Database connection pattern: `const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL);`
       - Repository query with navigation guides (lines 107-120)
       - Tool handler pattern and error handling (lines 97-289)
     
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/docs/mfai_mcp_server_reposel_roadmap.md`
       - Comprehensive roadmap document created for new MCP server
       - Updated to reference correct stdio server instead of SSE
       - Details project structure, phases, and implementation steps
       - Includes specific code patterns and database queries

     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server_cloudflare/src/index-sse.ts`
       - Initially referenced but corrected to use stdio server instead
       - Contains current navigation guide retrieval logic using SSE transport

  4. Problem Solving:
     - **Token Overflow Issue**: Identified that current MCP returns raw search results without intelligent filtering, causing 34,311 token responses
     - **Architecture Pattern**: Solved by adopting two-tool approach validated by Perplexity Sonar Pro
     - **Database Connection**: Simplified to use existing `MODFLOW_AI_MCP_00_CONNECTION_STRING` pattern
     - **Transport Protocol**: Clarified to use stdio for testing phase, not SSE
     - **Repository Selection**: Addressed user concern about repository selection importance in user workflows

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - Implement `mfai_mcp_server_reposel` following the detailed roadmap
     - Create repository selector tool using Google GenAI JS SDK
     - Test repository selection with sample queries like "What is PEST-IES?"
     - Implement intelligent search tool for confirmed repositories

  6. Current Work:
     The most recent work involved finalizing the roadmap documentation and correcting references. Specifically, the user requested updating the "Current Navigation System" 
  section in the roadmap to reference the correct stdio server. The edit was made to change from referencing the SSE server to the working stdio server:
     
     **Changed from:**
     ```
     ### Current Navigation System
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server_cloudflare/src/index-sse.ts`: Current navigation guide retrieval logic
     ```
     
     **Changed to:**
     ```
     ### Current Navigation System
     - `/home/danilopezmella/mfai_db_repos/mfai_mcp_server/src/index.ts`: Working stdio MCP server with navigation guide retrieval (lines 107-120)
     ```

  7. Optional Next Step:
     Based on the completed roadmap and the user's explicit request to solve the MCP content overflow issue, the next step would be to begin implementing the 
  `mfai_mcp_server_reposel` project following the detailed roadmap. This would start with Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure, specifically creating the project 
  directory structure and setting up the basic package configuration based on the working stdio server reference.
